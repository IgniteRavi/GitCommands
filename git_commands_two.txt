Making changes to files
---------------------------------
git diff
git diff --staged / --cached
git diff --color-word <file-name> 
git status


Git Delete
-------------------------------
git rm <file-name>


Git Moving and Renaming file
-------------------------------
git add <new file name>
git rm <old file name>
git status ( it would show that file is renamed from old file name --> new file name)

git mv <filename>  <newfilename> 
git status ( it would show that file is renamed from old file name --> new file name)



Undoing Changes
----------------------------------
git checkout (to checkout the branch)
git checkout <filename> ( to download the remote version of the file)

But what if we have the same file name and branch name
In that case : git checkout -- index.html ( -- make sure that the checkout is for the file not for the branch)
