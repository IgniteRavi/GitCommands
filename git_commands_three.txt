Git Ignore File
-----------------------------------
https://github.com/github/gitignore
	- Just select the type of the LANGUAGE, this would provide you the .gitingnore file initial version for that.

To Add global .gitignore file ( user specific instead of repository specific)
git config --global core.excludesfiles ~./gitignore_global

git rm --cached <filename> 
	TO ignore tracked file, means we want to delete the tracked file but still want to retain the copy of it.


To track Empty directorires that by defualt GIT does not track until we have any file in it, we could create ".gitkeep" file in the directory and it would be tracked.
